**a3-go-file** is a Flask service packaged the way a production service is packaged: a real package under `src/`, an environment-only configuration contract, structured JSON logs with request correlation, the five operational endpoints an orchestrator expects, a multi-stage container image, and CI gates that keep all of it honest.

This README is a measured document. Every number in it was produced on this exact checkout by the commands recorded in [docs/EVIDENCE.md](docs/EVIDENCE.md): **131 tests** run under pytest, **753 statements** traced by coverage, and **13 HTTP requests** issued over a real socket to the running server.

## At a glance

| Signal | Measured value | How it was measured |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tests passed | **131 / 131** | `python -m pytest -q` (exit code 0) |
| Test wall clock | 17.39 s | junit-xml suite time |
| Line coverage | **100.0%** | 753 of 753 statements executed, 0 missed |
| Source size | 1,497 lines / 15 modules | counted under `src/` |
| Test size | 1,369 lines / 14 files | counted under `tests/` |
| Documentation | 556 lines / 5 files | counted under `docs/` |
| Routes probed | 13 GET routes, 9 answered 200 | real HTTP against `127.0.0.1:<port>` |
| Total bytes served | 15.9 KB | 13 responses summed |
| Median response | 13.4 ms | median of 13 measured round trips |
| Screenshots | none captured | the build host cannot run a headless browser |

The slowest measured route was **27.3 ms** (`/`) and the fastest **4.9 ms** (`/api/health`). Every figure is a single uncached first request against the development server, so the spread reflects cold template rendering and lazy imports rather than steady-state latency.

## Screenshots

**No screenshot is committed for this project, because the host that built and measured this checkout cannot run a headless browser.** Nothing here pretends otherwise. What was actually attempted:

- Google Chrome in `--headless=new` mode exited with status **21** and wrote `OpenProcess: Access is denied. (0x5)` to its crashpad log; every `--dump-dom` run printed **0** characters.
- Microsoft Edge, installed at `C:/Program Files (x86)/Microsoft/Edge/Application/msedge.exe`, was tried next and dies one layer earlier still: `FATAL:mojo/public/cpp/platform/platform_channel.cc:187 Check failed: . : Access is denied. (0x5)`, with `crash server failed to launch`. It produced no PNG either.
- Playwright’s Chromium build fails at `launch()` with `PermissionError [WinError 5]`. Its `chrome-headless-shell.exe` is present on disk, so the blocker is the operating system’s denial above, not a missing binary.
- No further renderer exists to fall back on: neither `wkhtmltoimage` nor Firefox is installed.

Rather than commit a fabricated or placeholder image, the measured HTTP surface is published instead: every route's status code, byte size, content type and body is recorded in [docs/EVIDENCE.md](docs/EVIDENCE.md), the raw response bodies are quoted below, and the same numbers are charted. For the JSON endpoints that is the complete response a screenshot would show.

## Charts

Every chart is generated from the same measured JSON that renders the tables, by `_tools/_chartlib.py` - hand-written SVG with no plotting dependency - and committed so GitHub renders it without a build step.

## HTTP surface

Each route below was requested over TCP against the running server, started with `APP_ENV=production` so the production configuration path is the one under test. Static file routes are excluded: they are served by the WSGI container, not the application.

| # | Route | Status | Time | Bytes | Content type |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `/` | **200** | 27.3 ms | 5,703 | text/html; charset=utf-8 |
| 2 | `/api/files` | **200** | 7.5 ms | 13 | application/json |
| 3 | `/api/health` | **200** | 4.9 ms | 54 | application/json |

Status distribution: **200** x9, **403** x2, **404** x2. No response was a 5xx.

### Declared API contract

`openapi/a3_go_file.yaml` declares **6 paths** carrying **7 operations** (1 DELETE, 4 GET, 2 POST):

| Method | Path |
| --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/api/health` |
| `POST` | `/api/upload` |
| `GET` | `/s/<token>` |
| `POST` | `/s/<token>` |
| `GET` | `/dl/<token>` |
| `GET` | `/api/files` |
| `DELETE` | `/api/files/<id>` |

## Operational endpoints

Four of these are liveness and readiness plumbing for an orchestrator; `/metrics` is a Prometheus text exposition that needs no client library. The bodies below are captured verbatim from the running process.

`/healthz` answered **200**:

```json
{"service":"go_file","status":"ok","version":"0.1.0"}
```

`/livez` answered **200**:

```json
{"status":"alive"}
```

`/readyz` answered **200**:

```json
{"checks":[],"status":"ready"}
```

`/metrics` answered **200**:

```text
# TYPE http_requests_total counter http_requests_total{method="GET",status="200"} 4 # TYPE http_request_duration_seconds_sum counter http_request_duration_seconds_sum{method="GET"} 0.0406652 http_requests_total{method="GET",status="403"} 1 http_requests_total{method="GET",status="404"} 1 # TYPE process_uptime_seconds gauge process_uptime_seconds 0.920
```

`/version` answered **200**:

```

### Headers on every response

| Header | Observed value |
| --- | --- |

## Architecture

A small self-hosted file-sharing server: upload a file over HTTP, get back a short share link, and control that link with an optional password, an expiry and a download cap.

Deeper material: [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the module map and request lifecycle, [docs/OPERATIONS.md](docs/OPERATIONS.md) for running and configuring it, [docs/EVIDENCE.md](docs/EVIDENCE.md) for the raw recorded output this README quotes.

### Architecture decision records

| Record | Decision | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [0001-src-layout-and-runtime-state.md](docs/adr/0001-src-layout-and-runtime-state.md) | 1. Adopt a src/ layout with an explicit runtime state directory | accepted |
| [0002-hand-rolled-metric-exposition.md](docs/adr/0002-hand-rolled-metric-exposition.md) | 2. Hand-roll metric exposition instead of depending on prometheus_client | accepted |

## Requirements

Configuration is environment-only, in the twelve-factor sense: nothing is read from a committed file, and `.env.example` is the complete list of what the process understands.

| Variable | Example value |
| --- | --- |
| `APP_ENV` | `development` |
| `SECRET_KEY` | `change-me-in-production` |
| `HOST` | `0.0.0.0` |
| `PORT` | `8000` |
| `DEBUG` | `false` |
| `MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH` | `8388608` |
| `DATA_DIR` | `(empty)` |
| `INSTANCE_DIR` | `(empty)` |
| `LOG_DIR` | `(empty)` |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `INFO` |
| `LOG_JSON` | `true` |
| `REQUEST_ID_HEADER` | `X-Request-ID` |
| `UPLOAD_ROOT` | `(empty)` |
| `GOFILE_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:8000` |
| `ANALYTICS_SALT` | `change-me-in-production` |

## Quality gates

| Gate | Command | Result in this checkout |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tests | `python -m pytest -q` | **131 passed, 0 failed, 0 errors** in 17.39 s |
| Coverage | `python -m pytest --cov=src/go_file` | **100.0%** of 753 statements (0 missed) |
| Lint | `python -m pyflakes src tests conftest.py wsgi.py` | **0 findings** in this checkout (pyflakes is the static checker available here; ruff cannot run on this host) |
| Types | `python -m mypy --config-file mypy.ini src` | **no issues found in 15 source files** in this checkout |
| Container | `docker build .` | Dockerfile reviewed, **not executed** - no container runtime on this host |

`make lint` and `make type` run the pinned `ruff` and `mypy` from the project virtualenv that `make install` creates; CI runs the same two tools. This host has no network access, so the `ruff` pinned in `requirements-dev.txt` could not be installed; the Lint row reports `pyflakes`, the checker that actually ran here, rather than a tool that never executed. Both static checks were run over the checkout and their raw output is stored in `docs/EVIDENCE.md`.

Coverage clears the **85%** floor declared in `pyproject.toml` (`fail_under`), so the same command that produced the number above also passes the gate.

### Make targets

| Target | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `make help` | Show this help |
| `make install` | Create the virtualenv and install dev dependencies |
| `make fmt` | Auto-format (ruff is required; see requirements-dev.txt) |
| `make lint` | Lint without modifying anything |
| `make type` | Static type check |
| `make test` | Run the test suite |
| `make cov` | Run the test suite with coverage and enforce the floor |
| `make check` | The gate CI runs |
| `make run` | Start the development server |
| `make clean` | Remove caches and build artefacts |
| `make docker-build` | Build the container image |
| `make docker-run` | Run the container on port 8000 |

## Container image

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Build stages | 2 |
| Base images | `python:3.12-slim`, `python:3.12-slim` |
| COPY instructions | 4 |
| HEALTHCHECK | yes |
| Runs as non-root | yes |

`docker build` and `docker run` were **never executed** while this repository was produced: no container runtime is reachable from the generating host. The Dockerfile is a reviewed artefact, not a verified one.

## Continuous integration

| Workflow | Jobs | Steps | Commands |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ci.yml` | lint, test, security, container | 11 | ruff check src tests ; ruff format --check src tests ; mypy src |

## What this repository does not claim

- **No container run.** `docker build` was never executed.
- **No CI run.** The workflow files are real, but no GitHub runner has executed them from this checkout.
- **Static checks ran on this host, not the pinned toolchain.** `python -m pyflakes` and `python -m mypy` were executed here; `ruff` from the development requirements could not be installed on the generating host, so the lint gate named in `Makefile` is not the one that produced the numbers above.
- **No published artifact.** The package installs from this tree with `pip install -e .`; nothing was uploaded to an index.
- **Localhost only.** Every HTTP number was measured against `127.0.0.1` on the generating host, single-threaded, with no concurrency; treat them as smoke-test timings, not benchmarks.
- **No screenshots at all.** No headless browser can run on the generating host, so the interface is documented by recorded HTTP responses rather than by images. Nothing was mocked up to fill the gap.
